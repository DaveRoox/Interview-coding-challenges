# Interview coding challenges
This repository collects coding challenges assigned during technical interviews in big tech companies such as Google, Facebook, Apple and so on.<br>
I will propose my own solution in different languages (mainly C++, Python and Java) and, for each problem, different approaches will be evaluated, stating spatial and time complexity, what are the limits and how to design a better solution.

# Why?
I started this project with the hope to be a good starting point for everyone that is training in order to face a technical interview in the best way, or just for everyone that wants to have fun with some tricky problems.<br>
Also, this is a good opportunity for me too to keep training, so not why, but <b>why not?</b>

<b>---------------------------------------------------------------------------</b>

<b><h2>Search in sorted rotated array</h2></b>
Find a target number in sorted array with rotation.
Example: the array is [5, 7, 8, 1, 3]
Find the index of the number 7, the output is 1.
