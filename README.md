# Interview coding challenges
In this repository I collect coding challenges assigned during technical interviews in big tech companies.
I propose my own solution in different languages (mainly C++, Python and Java).
For each problem different approaches will be evaluated, stating spatial and time complexity, the limits and how to design a better solution.

# Why?
I started this project with the hope to be a good point to start from for everyone that is training in order to face a technical interview in the best way, or just for everyone that wants to have fun with some tricky problem.
Also, this is a good training for me too to keep training, so not why, but <b>why not?</b>
